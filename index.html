    <p style="line-height: 1.5;">Meet Kylie, a junior majoring in Compputer Science and minoring in "how many bugs will
       this <em>one</em> change make?" That's me. When I'm not battling with semicolons and questioning how 
       I've made it to college, I enjoy singing in a local choir. I also enojy playing piano for a children's
       choir--even though it stresses me out. I can often be seen escaping the reality of college through some
       wonderful book(currently on a Brandon Sanderson kick). However, despite the many headaches, I enjoy the problem solving of coding and perfer to work with
       C++. However, web development is something important to know, so this webpage is designed to showcase
       my JavaScript projects. Hope you enjoy. </p>
       <p>Thanks for coming to my TED talk.</p>
       <p>Hakuna Matata, have a good day,</p>
       <p>Kylie Olney<br>(I'm going to bed now)</p>
